# Suki
Your Favorite Character as your Companion 

## 🚀 Roadmap: Project Suki

**Concept:** This is Suki an Personal AI (Open Source), but with your favorite fictional character as your companion. We all loved our favorite characters but never get to meet and talk to them. Some of you might have well lucky for you guys. Well here is my team building this 


THERE WILL BE A DEFAULT WHO PREFERS DEFAULT 

### Core Principles

1. **Open Source Core**: The project is open source, meaning you can fork it to build your own version of your character. We plan to release it with an onboarding with building even Own OCs and different characters based on your choice.

2. **Paid Cloud Tier**: This project has a paid tier. If you don't want to handle any technical stuff, pay a monthly fee and we handle the rest.

3. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: You can bring your own LLM API keys and use it if you don't want to pay the monthly service fee.

4. **Service Fee Only**: Most importantly, we are only taking the fee for running the AI service. The characters you create—with their personality, voice, and animations—are up to you. We don't handle copyright issues for user-created content.

5. **Community & Marketplace**: Contributors can contribute to the project. We  plan to add a marketplace for different characters to use directly instead of creating your own version if your character is already built.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
